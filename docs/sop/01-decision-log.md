# 01 — Decision Log

Append-only. Newest at the bottom. A decision is not made until it's here.

---

### D-001 · 2026-08-20 · Rebuild arsancg.com from scratch
Full rebuild rather than incremental improvement of the existing site.
**Why:** existing site is thin and is being repositioned as the front door to a new
internal system. **Alternatives rejected:** patch the current site (doesn't support the
portal direction).

### D-002 · 2026-08-20 · Stack: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript strict + Tailwind + Framer Motion + Bun
**Why:** specified by Drew, and matches the standing house stack. Server Components by
default keeps JS shipped to the browser near zero on marketing pages; Framer Motion
covers the motion requirements with a `prefers-reduced-motion` escape hatch.
**Alternatives rejected:** none seriously considered — this is the house default.

### D-003 · 2026-08-20 · Scope includes a candidate/client portal, not just a brochure site
**Why:** Drew's call. The site is the public face of a real recruiting operation, not a
flyer. **Alternatives rejected:** brochure-only; brochure + job board.

### D-004 · 2026-08-20 · Data layer: Supabase for product data, GHL for CRM, synced
Supabase holds jobs/applications/resumes; GHL holds the contact record and owns all lead
communication (SMS, email, calls). **Why:** house rule — GHL is CRM system of record,
Supabase is product data; never conflated. **Alternatives rejected:** GHL-only (can't
model jobs); Supabase-only (loses CRM follow-up).

### D-005 · 2026-08-20 · Bilingual EN/ES built in from day one
Locale routing and message catalogs in P1, even if Spanish copy lands later.
**Why:** ARSAN's entire positioning is bilingual/bi-cultural US–Mexico; retrofitting i18n
means touching every route and component. Cheap now, expensive later.
**Alternatives rejected:** English-only; structure-now-content-later (kept as a fallback
if translation is slow — the architecture is identical either way).

### D-006 · 2026-08-20 · Phased delivery (P1→P4), each phase with its own spec and plan
**Why:** four independent subsystems in one spec produces a spec nobody can review and
locks in portal decisions before the marketing build teaches us anything.
**Alternatives rejected:** one big up-front spec; foundation-only-then-stop.

### D-007 · 2026-08-20 · Visual direction driven by reference images supplied by Drew
Not a from-scratch identity, not an evolution of the current brand.
**Status:** images pending. See [11-open-questions.md](11-open-questions.md).

### D-008 · 2026-08-20 · Jobs, auth, and candidate data are owned by a separate internal repo
The public site is a **client** of that system, not the owner of the schema. The
integration boundary (direct Supabase + RLS vs. an API the internal system exposes) is
undecided until that repo is reviewed.
**Why:** Drew is building the internal system separately; duplicating its schema here
would create two sources of truth. **Alternatives rejected:** site owns its own jobs
tables (guarantees drift).

### D-009 · 2026-08-20 · This SOP folder exists and is updated in real time
Location: `docs/sop/`. Rules in [README.md](README.md).
**Why:** Drew's request — capture tools, frameworks, packages, and prompts as we go so
the process is repeatable for the next client build.

### D-010 · 2026-08-20 · Project-root `CLAUDE.md` enforces SOP maintenance
Every session is instructed to log decisions, packages, prompts, and open questions as
they happen. **Why:** a SOP updated "at the end" is written from memory, and memory does
not survive context compaction. The rule has to live somewhere the harness reads on every
session start. **Alternatives rejected:** a PostToolUse hook on `package.json` changes
(more friction, can misfire — revisit if the CLAUDE.md rule proves too easy to skip);
relying on Drew to prompt for updates.

### D-011 · 2026-08-20 · Git initialized; SOP is the first commit
Repo initialized before any scaffolding. `.env.local` gitignored.
**Why:** the decision log is worth more with dates git can verify, and scaffolding
Next.js into an untracked directory means no clean diff of what the scaffold generated.
**Remote:** not yet created — deferred.

### D-012 · 2026-08-20 · Prompt log records decisions and turning points, not every message
`06-prompts.md` captures prompts that changed direction, produced real output, or failed —
verbatim, with the resulting lesson. Routine back-and-forth is omitted.
**Why:** a full transcript buries the reusable patterns. **Alternatives rejected:** log
everything verbatim; keep only distilled patterns with no context.

### D-013 · 2026-08-20 · SOP is ARSAN-specific for now
Not written as a reusable client-build template.
**Why:** extract the general playbook after one build actually finishes and we know which
parts held up. Generalizing before that is guessing.

### D-014 · 2026-08-20 · Internal system identified: Supabase project "AIOS"
Ref `aqonwletymrrukybyfzy`. Multi-tenant executive-search operating system, 40 objects,
schema complete and zero rows. Inspected read-only via PostgREST. Details and the three
findings that shape the website in [07-integrations.md](07-integrations.md).

### D-015 · 2026-08-20 · A `search` is not a job posting — publication must be an explicit act
AIOS `searches` are confidential client mandates carrying fee terms. The website will
never read them directly. Publishing a role to the public site requires a separate,
human-approved, public-safe record.
**Why:** publishing a search directly leaks client engagements and violates the
`confidential` / `selective_client_path` flags the schema already defines.
**Where it's built:** the AIOS repo owns the schema addition, not this one.
**Alternatives rejected:** filter `searches` by `confidential = false` on read (one
misconfigured row or policy publishes a client engagement — wrong layer for the guard).

### D-016 · 2026-08-20 · Site reaches AIOS through server-only credentials — no browser Supabase key
Server Components and server actions read/write AIOS with a server-only key. **No Supabase
credential is ever shipped to the browser.**
**Why:** AIOS holds candidate PII, `candidate_compensation` with legal disclosure gates,
and client fee terms across 40 tables. A browser anon key makes every RLS policy on every
table a public attack surface; one misconfiguration exposes the ATS. Server-only keeps one
source of truth without putting a credential on the public internet.
**Alternatives rejected:** browser anon key + RLS (blast radius); separate Supabase project
fed by domain events (strongest isolation, but a second project and a sync consumer to
build and monitor — revisit if the site ever needs data AIOS won't expose); build-time
static fetch (stale postings, deploy per publish).
**Note:** RLS is still required on every table regardless — this is defense in depth, not a
replacement.

### D-017 · 2026-08-20 · Website-driven schema additions are written as migrations in the AIOS repo
Claude writes them, in the AIOS repo, following that repo's existing migration and RLS
conventions. Two additions needed: a public-safe job-postings table (published by explicit
human approval from a `search`) and a write-only inbound intake table that triage promotes
to `candidates`.
**Why:** AIOS stays the sole owner of its schema. Two repos writing one schema means drift
and a migration-ordering problem the first time both change something.
**Blocked on:** the AIOS repo path. See [11-open-questions.md](11-open-questions.md) Q-01.

### D-018 · 2026-08-20 · P1 starts now, in parallel with the boundary work
The marketing site needs zero AIOS data. Scaffold and build proceeds while schema and
integration questions resolve.
